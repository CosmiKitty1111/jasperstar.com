# Project Structure Rules

## Page Structure Convention

All pages in this project must follow a consistent folder-based structure:

### Rule: Pages Must Use Folder Structure with index.html

**Structure Pattern:**
- Each page/section should be in its own folder
- The folder should contain an `index.html` file
- The folder name becomes the URL path (without `/index.html`)

**Examples:**
- ✅ `404/index.html` → accessible at `/404/`
- ✅ `PetsRUsWebsite/food/index.html` → accessible at `/PetsRUsWebsite/food/`
- ✅ `PetsRUsWebsite/adopt/index.html` → accessible at `/PetsRUsWebsite/adopt/`
- ✅ `PetsRUsWebsite/cart/index.html` → accessible at `/PetsRUsWebsite/cart/`
- ✅ Root `index.html` → accessible at `/` (exception for root)

**Exceptions:**
- Root `index.html` is allowed at the repository root for the main landing page
- `404.html` at root is required for GitHub Pages compatibility (but should redirect to `/404/`)

**Why:**
- Consistent URL structure (clean URLs without `.html` extensions)
- Easier to organize related assets per page
- Matches modern web development practices
- Works seamlessly with URL rewriting rules

**When Creating New Pages:**
1. Create a folder with the page name (e.g., `about/`, `contact/`)
2. Create `index.html` inside that folder
3. Update URL rewrite rules if needed
4. Ensure relative paths are correct for assets

## Git Workflow Rules

### Production Branch Name
- **ALWAYS** use `release/prod` (not `Prod`, `prod`, or any other variation)
- The production branch is `release/prod` - this is case-sensitive and must include the `release/` prefix
- If I refer to a branch as `prod` I mean `release/prod`.

### Pull Requests and Merges
- **ALWAYS** use GitHub MCP tools for creating pull requests and merging
- **NEVER** use direct git merge commands for cross-branch merges
- Use `mcp_GitHub_-_CosmiKitty1111_create_pull_request` to create PRs
- Use `mcp_GitHub_-_CosmiKitty1111_merge_pull_request` to merge PRs
- This ensures proper PR tracking, code review visibility, and GitHub workflow integration

**Workflow Pattern:**
1. Commit and push changes to feature branch
2. Create PR from feature branch to master using MCP
3. Merge PR using MCP
4. Create PR from master to `release/prod` using MCP
5. Merge PR using MCP

### Production Workflow
The standard production workflow follows this pattern:
- **Feature Branch → Master → Production**
- Always use feature/bugfix branches (never commit directly to master or release/prod)
- Use verbose commit message
- Create pull requests using GitHub MCP tools (not direct git merges)
- After merging to master, immediately create and merge a PR to `release/prod` to deploy to production
- This ensures proper code review, PR tracking, and deployment visibility

**Quick Command:** To trigger the full production workflow, use: `"do my standard prod workflow"` or `"run prod workflow"`

### Note
- Never commit straight to master or release/prod. Always create/use a feature, bugfix or simlarly prefixed branch first, then pull request into master using GitHub MCP tools
